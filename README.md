# Welcome to Philitas-Server!

This repository represents the backend of Philitas iOS app.
I haven't deployed this repository to a remote server yet, so it's best to use it on a Mac computer in combination with Philitas iOS app.

NOTE: You can also use it separately on a PC (simulation with Postman), but you won't be able to run an iOS app because the iOS SDK is locked on a Mac.

# Installation (for Mac & PC)

- Download NodeJS from [NodeJS official site](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
- Once NodeJS is set, run `npm install -g typescript` in Terminal / Command Prompt.
- Either clone or download this repository.
- Navigate via Terminal / Command Prompt to the location of the cloned repository.
- Inside root folder (where Package.json is located), run `npm run install`.

# Run (for Mac & PC)

- Run `npm run dev`.
- You should get message: `Server started on port: 3002`
